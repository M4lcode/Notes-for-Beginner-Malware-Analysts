# Notes for Beginner Malware Analysts

In this repo, I'll write some important notes for beginner malware analysts.

# Where can I find labs for the Practical Malware Analysis book?

To obtain the labs, download the .exe file from [here](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs) and run it. This will extract the labs to a directory of your choice.

# How can I search for malware samples in Malware Bazaar?

First, go to Malware Bazaar and navigate to the browse section [here](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/). 

If you have the malware hash, use this syntax:

```
sha265:hash_value
or
md5:hash_value
```

Remember the following:

- Do not add spaces before or after the hash.
- Ensure that you've formatted the syntax correctly.

If you've followed these instructions and Malware Bazaar doesn't return an error message, it means that the sample isn't in its database.

# "This program requires module olefile" error messege in oledump.py

First you should install olefile.

```
pip install olefile
```

If you have installed it and the error keep showing, go to "C:\Users\M4lcode\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts" and copy "olefile.exe" and paste it in DidierStevensSuite-master folder.
